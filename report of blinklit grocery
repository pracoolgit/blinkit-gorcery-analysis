 🧮 Sample DAX Measures (Power BI)
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Amount])

Total Orders = COUNT(Sales[Order ID])

Average Order Value = [Total Sales] / [Total Orders]

Profit Margin % = DIVIDE(SUM(Sales[Profit]), SUM(Sales[Amount]), 0)

Repeat Customer Rate = DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Customer ID]), Sales[Order Count] > 1),
    DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Customer ID])
)
